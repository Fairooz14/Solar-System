# Solar System Simulation Using OpenGL

## Overview
This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system created using OpenGL. It provides an interactive visualization of the Sun, planets, their orbits and a starfield background. Users can explore the system with  rotation controls, observing realistic planetary motion.

## Output
Below is a snapshot of the output:

## Features
- Realistic rendering of the Sun with a glowing effect.
- Accurate representation of planets, their colors, and sizes.
- Dynamic orbital paths and rotations.
- Static starfield for a realistic space environment.
- User controls for rotating the view.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **OpenGL**
- **GLUT** for window and event management.

## Controls
- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate the view around the solar system.

## Methodology
The project uses OpenGL for rendering and simulating the following:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set up the 3D environment, lighting, and materials.
2. **Rendering Loop**:
   - Draw the Sun with a glowing effect.
   - Render planets and their orbits dynamically.
   - Display planet names with enhanced readability.
3. **User Interaction**:
   - Allow rotation for an immersive experience.
